## Description

The point of minishell is to make a simple shell that mimics certain bash functionalities.

## Core Features

- Implementation of a prompt waiting for commands.
- Execution of basic commands found in the PATH.
- Implementation of key built-in commands: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`.
- Handling of environment variables.
- Implementation of simple redirections (`>`, `<`, `>>`) and pipes (`|`).
- Handling of `$?` to reflect the return status of the last executed command.
- Signal handling (`Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-\`).

## Bonus Features

Advanced functionalities enhance the basic implementation, such as:

- **Advanced Redirections**: Handling of more complex redirection scenarios.
- **Command line editing**: Implementing features allowing line editing with termcap.
- **Improved expandability**: Better handling of environment variables and expansions.
